# Problem Sets

## Problem set rules
Each problem set will consist of a written and programming portion. This course’s policy on academic honesty builds on the honor code and is best stated as "be reasonable." We recognize that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between asking for help and submitting someone else’s work. For individual assignments students are permitted to ask classmates and others for conceptual help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you (e.g., writing your response, copy-pasting code, or making your slides). Please review the Academic Integrity section of the syllabus for more information.

## Problem set submission
Make sure to submit your final written PDF to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/820552) as well as you final **modified** code files per the coding pset instructions. When you complete the assignment (and honestly at any major checkpoint) you should always back up your code to a private github repo, to your gdrive, or some other external storage device!
